<?php

/*Each method and property has its visibility. 
There are three types of visibility in PHP. 
They are declared by keywords public, protected and private. 
Each one of them controls how a method/property can be accessed by outsiders.

Public: It allows anyone from outside access its method/property. 
This is the default visibility in PHP class when no keywords are prefixed to a method/property.

Protected: It only allows itself or children classes to access its method/property.

Private: It does not allow anyone except itself to access its method/property./*
